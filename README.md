# QiskitContest2019
#This project was created during the Qiskit Contest which took place at University of Birmingham.

#The file called "encrypt" takes the input and encrypts it. This is done character by character(RSA type of encryption).

#The file called "decrypt" uses a quantum computer simulation(takes place on IBM servers) in order 
to calculate the prime numbers that allow us to decrypt the message. After that the program goes through the string,
character by character and decrypts it.
